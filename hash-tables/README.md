# Hash Tables Sprint Challenge

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through some algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the `.c` skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with `make tests`.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (ideally using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the `hashtable.h` header file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly). 

## Rubric

Both problems will be graded out of 5 points:

* 1: Code attempted
* 2: Code resembles the correct solution
* 3: Tests pass
* 4: Tests pass, no hash table memory leaks
* 5: Tests pass, no hash table memory leaks, linear runtime complexity
