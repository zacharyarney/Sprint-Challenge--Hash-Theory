## State Machines

> A useful tool for drawing state machines is [Evan's FSM
> Designer](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/).

* The VT-100 terminal (console) outputs text to the screen as it
  receives it over the wire. One exception is that when it receives an
  ESC character (ASCII 27), it goes into a special mode where it looks
  for commands to change its behavior. For example:

      ESC[12;45f

  moves the cursor to line 12, column 45.

      ESC[1m

  changes the font to bold.

  * Draw a state machine diagram for a VT-100 that can consume regular
    character sequences as well as the two above ESC sequences.

## Computation

Fill out truth tables for the following expressions:

1. `(A ∧ ¬B)`   (alternate: `(A && !B)`)
```
A     B     result
-------------------
0     0       ?
0     1       ?
1     0       ?
1     1       ?
```

2. `(¬A ∨ B) ∧ ¬(A ∧ ¬B)`   (alternate: `(!A || B) && !(A && !B)`)
```
A     B     result
-------------------
0     0       ?
0     1       ?
1     0       ?
1     1       ?
```

3. `¬(A ∧ B) ∨ ( (A ∧ C) ∧ ¬(B ∨ ¬C) )`   (alternate: `!(A && B) || ( (A && C) && !(B || !C) )`)
  * (Hint: Is it possible to calculate this using code?)
```
A     B     C     result
-------------------------
0     0     0       ?
0     0     1       ?
0     1     0       ?
0     1     1       ?
1     0     0       ?
1     0     1       ?
1     1     0       ?
1     1     1       ?
```

## STRETCH GOAL

The sum of two binary digits can be represented with the following truth table:

* A + B
```
A     B     CARRY   SUM
------------------------
0     0       0      0
0     1       0      1
1     0       0      1
1     1       1      0
```
This can be represented with boolean algebra like so:

* `SUM = A ⊕ B`  (alternate: `A ^ B` or `A xor B`)
* `CARRY = A ∧ B`  (alternate: `A && B`)


How can you represent the SUM and CARRY of adding THREE digits with a truth table and in boolean algebra?

* A + B + C
```
A     B     C      carry   sum
--------------------------------
0     0     0        ?      ?
0     0     1        ?      ?
0     1     0        ?      ?
0     1     1        ?      ?
1     0     0        ?      ?
1     0     1        ?      ?
1     1     0        ?      ?
1     1     1        ?      ?
```
* SUM = ?
* CARRY = ?
